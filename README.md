Dijkstra_Algorithm
==================

 Dijkstr's Algorithm is a graph search algorithm that solves the single-source
 shortest path problem for a graph with non-negative edge path costs, producing
 a shortest path tree. This algorithm is often used in routing and as a subroutine
 in other graph algorithms.
 
 input.text contains the test cases for the program.
 First line implies the no: pf vertices and second one implies the no: of edges.
 Then the edges with is specified.
